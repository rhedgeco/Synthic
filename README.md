# Synthic

Synthic is a realtime audio synthesis pipeline built for the Unity Engine.

Take a look at my [blog posts](https://blog.hedgecock.dev/2022/unity-audio-generation-simple-sounds/) and youtube videos that go more in depth on how this was put together and its main goals.

This current branch is exploring using native code built in rust, for the original branch used in the blog and video, please check the [`old-synthic`](https://github.com/rhedgeco/Synthic/tree/old-synthic) branch.
